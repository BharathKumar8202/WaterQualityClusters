# Clustering Analysis of Water Quality 💧🐟

**Overview:**  
Dive into the world of water quality analysis! This problem applies clustering techniques to water quality data to understand and protect aquatic life. We use both K-Means and Agglomerative Clustering to reveal hidden patterns.

**What's Inside:**  
- **Data & Preprocessing:** Clean and transform water quality data (e.g., pH, temperature, turbidity) and visualize key metrics.  
- **Clustering Models:**  
  - **K-Means:** Determine the optimal clusters using the elbow method and PCA for dimensionality reduction.  
  - **Agglomerative Clustering:** Build hierarchical clusters and visualize them with a dendrogram.  
- **Evaluation:** Compare clustering performance with silhouette scores to pick the best method.

**Why It Rocks:**  
Perfect for environmental enthusiasts! Learn how data science can drive real-world conservation efforts and help maintain healthy aquatic ecosystems. 🌟
